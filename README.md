Technologies used: NodeJS, expressJS, React-ExpressJS, PSQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS and Cloudinary.

Approach taken: 
It is CRUD(Create, read, update and delete) app with RESTful routes built upon the MVC of expressJS and NodeJS and PSQL for the backend.

Users can submit a form to add their clothes into the database. For example, some of the form items are name, brand, colour, categories etc. Hence users can use it to organize and sort their clothing.

It also features user image upload for pictures of their own clothing. Cloudinary was also used for online image storage.

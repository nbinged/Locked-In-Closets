## Functions:
It works as a CRUD(Create, read, update and delete) app with RESTful routes built upon the framework MVC using expressJS and NodeJS and PostgreSQL for database.

Users can submit a form to add their clothes into the database. For example, some of the form items are name, brand, colour, categories etc. Hence users can use it to organize and sort their clothing based on type, colour etc.

It also features user image upload for pictures of their own clothing. Cloudinary was also used for online image storage.
